		<h2>Package removal</h2>
		<p>
			pesde does not support removing packages from the registry without a reason such as security
			or complying with the law. In case you published a secret to the registry, you must regenerate
			it. If you believe a package should be removed, please <a href="mailto:pesde@daimond113.com"
				>contact us</a
			>. We will review your request and take action if necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we find that a package is breaking the permitted content policy, we will remove it from the
			registry without notice.
		</p>
		<p>
			pesde reserves the right to remove any package from the registry at any time for any reason.

		<h2>Package ownership</h2>
		<p>
			Packages are owned by scopes. The first person to publish to the scope owns the scope. If you
			want to work as a team, the owner of the scope must send a pull request to the <a
				href="https://github.com/daimond113/pesde-index">index repo</a
			> adding the members' user IDs to the scope's `owners.yaml` file.
		</p>

		<h2>Scope squatting</h2>
		<p>
			Scope squatting is the act of creating a scope with the intent of preventing others from using
			it. Scope squatting is not allowed. If you believe a scope is being squatted, please
			<a href="mailto:pesde@daimond113.com">contact us</a>. We will review your request and take
			action if necessary.
