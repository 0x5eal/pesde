# pesde

pesde is a package manager for Roblox that is designed to be feature-rich and easy to use.
Currently, pesde is in a very early stage of development, but already supports the following features:

- Managing dependencies
- Re-exporting types
- `bin` exports (ran with Lune)
- Patching packages

## Installation

pesde can be installed from GitHub Releases. You can find the latest release [here](https://github.com/daimond113/pesde/releases).
It can also be installed by using [Aftman](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).

## Hosting

The pesde registry is hosted on [fly.io](https://fly.io). You can find the registry [here](https://registry.pesde.daimond113.com).

## Previous art

pesde is heavily inspired by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [wally](https://wally.run), and [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). It aims to take the best parts of each package manager and combine them into one.
